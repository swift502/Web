description: Experimental Godot engine project attempting to replicate gameplay mechanics found in the Mirror's Edge games. I began by creating a custom character controller with both first and third person view modes.

    desc: I began by creating a custom character controller with both first and third person view modes. Next I created an obstacle detection system, the ability to vault, climb, hang from ledges, wallrun and many other parkour mechanics with placeholder animations.

    desc: The [Octarr](/projects/octarr/) data structure was used to quickly create level geometry. Since obstacle detection is completely universal, it works on generic, dynamically placed objects like this.

      Combining everything together, I've created a sample level with enemy drones and turrets, item pickups, bases to destroy and NPC delivery tasks. The idea is that all tasks within the level have to be completed within the given time limit, which makes for a fun challenge.
      While the project is nowhere near complete, creating all these systems has been a lot of fun and I hope to come back to it at some point in the future.
