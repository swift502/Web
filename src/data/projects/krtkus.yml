      A custom design for an ortholinear keyboard. The PCB was designed in Kicad, and case in Blender. It's powered by Arduino Pro Micro running VIA-compatible QMK.
      The board is completely open source. The PCB, case and firmware are available on the project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/swift502/Krtkus).
