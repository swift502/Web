    desc: A collection of 3D character-focused dioramas published [on Sketchfab](https://skfb.ly/oxq9M). Their art style is an evolution of the techniques used in the [Character experiments](/projects/characters/) project with fewer restrictions on poly count, yet still striving to retain the classic low poly aesthetic.
