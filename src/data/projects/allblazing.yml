      A low poly runner character set made for the AllBlazing app by Mark Trewren. The app focused on running motivation and tracking, but was unfortunately discontinued and is no longer available.
      Characters follow the same style I came up with in [Character experiments](/projects/characters/), just feature different outfits. The intention was for the user to select a skin tone, outfit and accent color. Those choices would dynamically form a 3D user avatar, which you'd see on a map to show your current location.
