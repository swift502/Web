      A Visual Studio Code theme designed to improve highlighting of .fountain files while using the [Better Fountain](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piersdeseilligny.betterfountain) extension. With the lack of modern cross-platform Fountain format editors, Visual Studio Code currently stands out as one of the better ones. However it's lacking in specialized themes.
      As a long time Kimbie Dark user, I decided to modify the syntax highlighting to make it work a little better, improve contrast issues and eliminate theme features unsuitable for screenwriting.

      Fortunately the source code of the built-in themes easy to find, and with a few modifications I managed to craft the perfect screenwriting VSCode theme, as niche as this use case might be.
      The theme is now available as an extension in the Visual Studio Code Marketplace [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jan-blaha.kimbie-fountain-theme).
