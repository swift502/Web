    desc: BeamNG.drive port of GTA 3's Liberty City. I first extended <a href="https://github.com/Parik27/DragonFF">DragonFF</a>, an open source dff importer to be able to import entire map segments. The actual conversion process then involved a lot of script automated data structure conversion, road path generation and geometry and material cleanup work.
